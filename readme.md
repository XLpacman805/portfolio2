# Portfolio 2 #

Redoing my portfolio site. I hate the old one. This one is build with modern Javascript. It operates like a single page app, and even has state and compononets but is all vanilla JS. I think React is overhead and isn't the solution for everything. I'm also moving most of projects off of GCloud onto a Linode Debian server running apache. Gcloud is easy to use and has all the scaling I could ever ask for but the cost isn't worth it for a low traffic website this one.
